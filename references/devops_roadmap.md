### FTP / SFTP

# FTP / SFTP

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It operates on a client-server model, typically using separate control and data connections between the client and server. FTP allows users to upload, download, and manage files on remote systems, supporting both authenticated and anonymous access. While widely used for its simplicity and compatibility, FTP has security limitations as it transmits data and credentials in plain text. As a result, more secure alternatives like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP Secure) have gained popularity for sensitive data transfers. Despite its age, FTP remains in use for various file transfer needs, especially in legacy systems and where security is less critical.

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol that provides file access, transfer, and management functionalities over a secure shell (SSH) data stream. It's designed as an extension of SSH to offer secure file transfer capabilities. SFTP encrypts both commands and data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Unlike traditional FTP, SFTP uses a single connection and doesn't separate control and data channels. It supports features like resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal. SFTP is widely used in enterprise environments for secure file transfers, automated scripts, and as a more secure alternative to FTP. Its integration with SSH makes it a preferred choice for system administrators and developers working with remote systems securely.

### White / Grey Listing

# White Listing vs Grey Listing

Whitelisting involves creating a list of trusted entities (such as IP addresses, email addresses, or applications) that are explicitly allowed to access a system or send messages. Anything not on the whitelist is denied by default. Whitelisting offers a high level of security by limiting access to only known and approved entities, but it can be inflexible and require frequent updates to accommodate legitimate changes. Greylisting is a more flexible approach used primarily in email filtering. When an email is received from an unknown sender, the server temporarily rejects it with a "try again later" response. Legitimate mail servers will retry sending the email after a short delay, while spammers, which often do not retry, are blocked. This method reduces spam by taking advantage of the fact that spammers usually do not follow retry mechanisms. Greylisting can be less intrusive than whitelisting, but it may introduce slight delays in email delivery for first-time senders.

### SMTP

# SMTP

Email is emerging as one of the most valuable services on the internet today. Most internet systems use SMTP as a method to transfer mail from one user to another. SMTP is a push protocol and is used to send the mail whereas POP (post office protocol) or IMAP (internet message access protocol) are used to retrieve those emails at the receiver’s side. SMTP is an application layer protocol. The client who wants to send the mail opens a TCP connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection. The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection through port 25. After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.

### DMARC

# DMARC

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is an email authentication protocol that builds upon SPF and DKIM to protect against email spoofing and phishing attacks. It allows domain owners to specify how email receivers should handle messages that fail authentication checks. DMARC provides a feedback mechanism for domain owners to receive reports on email authentication results, helping them monitor and improve their email security. By implementing DMARC policies, organizations can enhance their email deliverability, protect their brand reputation, and reduce the likelihood of their domain being used in fraudulent email campaigns. DMARC is widely adopted by major email providers and is considered a crucial component of modern email security strategies.

### POP3S

# Pop3s

POP3 (port 110) or POP3s (port 995) stands for The Post Office Protocol. It's an Internet standard protocol used by local email software clients to retrieve emails from a remote mail server over a TCP/IP connection. Email servers hosted by Internet service providers also use POP3 to receive and hold emails intended for their subscribers. Periodically, these subscribers will use email client software to check their mailbox on the remote server and download any emails addressed to them. Once the email client has downloaded the emails, they are usually deleted from the server, although some email clients allow users to specify that mails be copied or saved on the server for a period of time.

### Domain Keys

# Domain Keys

DomainKeys is an email authentication method designed to verify the domain of an email sender and ensure message integrity. Developed by Yahoo, it was a precursor to DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail). DomainKeys uses public key cryptography to allow email systems to verify that a message was sent by an authorized sender and hasn't been tampered with in transit. The sending server signs outgoing emails with a private key, and receiving servers can verify the signature using a public key published in the sender's DNS records. While largely superseded by DKIM, DomainKeys played a crucial role in the evolution of email authentication techniques aimed at combating email spoofing and phishing attacks.

### Chef

# Chef

Emerging in 2009, Chef (now known as Progress Chef) is one of the earliest configuration management tools to gain popularity. Chef "Recipes" are written in Ruby, in a primarily declarative style. Chef requires that a client is installed on a server being managed. This client polls a Chef-Server regularly, to determine what its configuration should be. Chef-Solo is also available, a version of Chef that allows provisioning of a single node by running chef locally. A key tenet of Chef recipe design is the concept of idempotence. All Chef recipes should be runnable multiple times and produce the same result - this is especially necessary in cases where the client/server model listed above is in use. This pattern of configuration management is highly influential for future declarative tools like Terraform and Cloud Formation.

### Availability

# Availability

Availability is the percentage of time that a system is functional and working as intended, generally referred to as uptime. Availability can be affected by hardware or software errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks, and system load. Many cloud providers typically offer their users a service level agreement (SLA) that specifies the exact percentages of promised uptime/downtime. Availability is related to reliability in this sense. For example, a company might promise 99.99% uptime for their services.
